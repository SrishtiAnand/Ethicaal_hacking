This project focuses on ethical network penetration testing by simulating real-world exploits to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities within a network environment. 
It involves conducting systematic assessments using industry-standard tools such as Nmap, Metasploit, and others to perform reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation analysis.
The objective is to uncover weaknesses in network configurations, services, and access controls, and then apply appropriate security remediation techniques.
As part of this ethical hacking project, John the Ripper was utilized to assess the strength of password security within the target network environment.
After gaining access to hashed password files through successful exploitation or enumeration, John the Ripper was employed to perform offline password cracking using various attack modes such as dictionary attacks and brute-force methods. This helped identify weak or commonly used passwords that could be easily compromised by an attacker.
 The cracked credentials were then analyzed to demonstrate potential escalation paths or lateral movement across the network.
 Following the cracking process, remediation steps such as enforcing strong password policies, implementing account lockout mechanisms, and promoting the use of multi-factor authentication were suggested to improve overall security.
 This use of John the Ripper highlighted the critical importance of password hygiene in securing network systems.
